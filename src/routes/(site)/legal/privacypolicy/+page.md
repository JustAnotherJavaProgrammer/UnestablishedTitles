This site does not use cookies.

**Web Storage**  
Instead of cookies, we use a technology known as [Web Storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API) as a means of locally storing data like your site preferences. This data is not sent via the network and is only processed locally on your device.

**Hosting**  
Our host collects the following data in so-called log files that your browser transmits:

IP address, the address of the previously visited website (Referer request header), date and time of the request, time zone difference to Greenwich Mean Time, content of the request, HTTP status code, transmitted data volume, website from which the request was made and information about the browser and operating system.

This is necessary to display our website and ensure stability and security. This corresponds to our legitimate interest within the meaning of [Article 6 (1) sentence 1 point (f) GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/article-6-how-to-process-personal-data-legally/).

There is no tracking and we do not have direct access to this data, but only receive an anonymized, statistical summary. This includes the address of the previously visited page, the frequency of each page viewed and the number of unique visitors. We do not combine this data with other data.

We use the following host to provide our website:

This is the recipient of your personal data. This corresponds to our legitimate interest within the meaning of [Article 6 (1) sentence 1 point (f) GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/article-6-how-to-process-personal-data-legally/) to not have to maintain a server on our premises. The server location is the USA.

You have the right to object to the processing of your data. Whether the objection is successful is to be determined as part of a balancing of interests.

The data will be deleted as soon as the purpose of the processing no longer applies.

The processing of the data specified in this section is neither legally nor contractually required. The functionality of the website cannot be guaranteed without the processing.
